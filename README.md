## Prelude

This workshop was presented as the sixth installment of Hackschool 2023, a workshop series offered by ACM Hack at UCLA. Its intended audience is those new to web development who may be be thinking about pursuing a career as a Software Engineer or Full Stack Developer or some other name for someone who codes for a living. Check out the slides for the workshop and our website below.

### Goals
1. Learn about **AI Driven Development**
2. Learn about APIs and Network Requests
3. Integrate an AI assistant into a simple notes app
4. Predict the future of Software Engineering?

*Disclaimer*: Particularly with regards to the future of Software Engineering, I do not know what I am talking about. I'm doing my best based on the information available to me, but it could very well be wrong. Do your own research! Without further ado, let's get started.


## The State of AI

Unless you've been living under a rock, you've probably heard of ChatGPT. It was released almost exactly a year ago now, and has since grown faster than (almost) any other product ever released, hitting 100 million users in just two months.

With its explosive growth has also come a lot of concern over how it might impact the world ten or twenty years down the line. So many people -- writers, artists, coders -- are scared they're going to be replaced. Recently we saw one of the longest writer's strikes ever in Hollywood, and one of their biggest demands was to disallow the use of generative AI by entertainment companies. Eventually the media agreed to this demand, but it's not clear how long they intend to uphold that promise. Beyond that, we've seen a lot of outrage from people who produce content: they claim their work is being stolen by companies like OpenAI to train their models. Yikes! 

So it's a bit of a moral grey area. At least that's how it feels to me. That being said, I don't think its productive to just sit around and wait while our government catches up and starts regulating things. We might as well learn to use it to our advantage! 

It's worth noting that the current consensus is that generative AI is not going to replace software engineers anytime soon, though it will certainly automate away much of the tedium involved. ChatGPT and even GPT 4 seem very sophisticated from a surface level, but they have one huge flaw: they are incapable of synthesizing new ideas. This means that fields that require creativity and innovation are safe for the time being. Fingers crossed.
